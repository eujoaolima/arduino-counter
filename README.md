# arduino-counter

Basicly, this project is similar to "arduino-led-button" project, but the difference is that the button will always trigger a count of +1 value when pressed, being shown on console.

When the value is the same configured in the IDE, the leds will turn on and, posteriorly, will turn off when reaching another value, also resetting the count.
